       "'amnesty chief laments war failure the lack of public outrage about the war on terror is a powerful indictment of the failure of human rights groups  amnesty international s chief has said.  in a lecture at the london school of economics  irene khan said human rights had been flouted in the name of security since 11 september  2001. she said the human rights movement had to use simpler language both to prevent scepticism and spread a moral message. and it had to fight poverty  not just focus on political rights for elites.  ms khan highlighted detentions without trial  including those at the us camp at guantanamo bay in cuba  and the abuse of prisoners as evidence of increasing human rights problems.  what s a new challenge is the way in which this age-old debate on security and human rights has been translated into the language of war   she said.  by using the language of war  human rights are being sidelined because we know human rights do not apply in times of war.  ms khan said such breaches were infectious and were now seen in almost very major country in the world.  the human rights movement faces a crisis of faith in the value of human rights   she said. that was accompanied by a crisis of governance  where the united nations system did not seem able to hold countries to account.  the amnesty secretary-general said a growing gap between the perceived influence of human rights group and what they could actually achieve was fuelling scepticism.  public passivity on the war against terror is the single most powerful indictment on the failures of human rights groups   she said. ms khan said the movement had failed to mobilise public outrage about what was happening to the human rights system. there needed to be a drive to use simpler language  talking about the basic morality of the issues rather than the complexity of legal processes. such efforts could make the issues more relevant to people across the world  she said.  the human rights groups also had to recognise there were new groups which had to be tackled in new ways as power dripped away from state governments. al-qaeda  for example  was not going to be impressed by a traditional amnesty letter writing campaign. more also needed to be done to develop a human rights framework for international business corporations. amnesty international members voted in 2001 to extend the organisation s work from political and civil rights to cover social and economic rights too. ms khan said the human rights movement would make itself irrelevant if it turned away from the suffering caused by economic strife.  we would be an elitist bunch working for the elites  for those who cannot read the newspaper of their choice rather than those who cannot read   she said. despite her concerns  ms khan dubbed herself a  hope-monger   saying she was confident the passions of the human rights movement could overcome the new challenges.'"

       "'redford s vision of sundance despite sporting a corduroy cap pulled low over his face plus a pair of dark glasses  robert redford cuts an unmistakable figure through the star-struck crowds at sundance.  it s a rare downtown appearance for the man who started the annual festival in park city  utah back in the 1980s. now in its twenty-first year  sundance continues to grow. some 45 000 people are estimated to have descended on this small ski town with nothing but movies on the mind. it s an opportunity to meet and make deals. redford wanted sundance to be a platform for independent film-makers  but the commercial success of many showcased films have led to criticism that the festival is becoming too mainstream.  smaller festivals like slamdance and xdance  which take place during the same week in park city  are competing for sundance s limelight. but redford is not worried.  the more the merrier   he says.  the point was to create opportunities for people who may not have them.  once independent film had a place where the work could be seen  suddenly the merchants came. with them the celebrities came  then the paparazzi - and suddenly it began to take on a whole new tone   explains redford.   people started to say we had gone mainstream and hollywood  but actually hollywood came to us because suddenly there was good business in independent film   he adds. international film-makers have always been celebrated here  but 2005 is the first year a dedicated world dramatic and documentary competition is being held.  redford wants the festival to encompass viewpoints he believes the american media fails to reflect  particularly how the us is perceived internationally. he has never hidden the fact that he is a democrat. but he reserves particular disdain for the current republican administration.  it s the ability to maintain the importance of dissent in a democratic system which right now is under threat with the attitude of this administration   he says.  i think many voices are being shut down or accused of being unpatriotic if they want to express another point of view. that s very unhealthy and very dangerous.   if we take that policy into the world  there will be the same victims and the same consequences.  sundance isn t just one big screening. there are discussion panels and q&a sessions with directors tackling controversial topics like america s  culture wars  and the iraq war. while redford wishes the festival to be a forum for dissent  the profile of the audience is fairly monolithic. educated  middle class and predominantly white americans comes sundance  with views from the same end of the political spectrum - anti-war and socially liberal. but redford knows this and started the sundance tv channel in an effort to reach a wider audience.  when you look at the films here  what we are presenting is very much egalitarian. and it s about good films and good story-telling be it african america  asian  women  gay  lesbian.  sooner or later we will do away with those stereotypical labels and people will say  it s just a film by so-and so .'"
